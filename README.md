# Caption Anything in Any Style

We build an appealing demo by combining [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything), Visual Captioning, and [ChatGPT](), which is capable to caption any pieces in the image in various language styles.

Caption-Anything supports both visual controls and textual controls: 
### Visual Controls
